## About The Project

### Legend:
"Sneaker World" is an online store that specializes in selling a wide range of sneakers. The store was founded by a group of passionate sneaker enthusiasts who wanted to create a platform where people could find the latest and most exclusive sneaker releases.

The founders of "Sneaker World" believed that there was a lack of reliable and trustworthy sources for sneaker enthusiasts to purchase their favorite sneakers. They wanted to create a store that would offer a wide selection of sneakers from various brands, as well as provide customers with a convenient and secure shopping experience.

Since its inception, "Sneaker World" has grown rapidly, attracting customers from all over the world. The store offers a wide range of sneakers from popular brands such as Nike, Adidas, and Puma, as well as limited edition and exclusive releases.

### Real Story:
"Sneaker World" is an e-commerce pet-project for developing skills in creating a web application. I hope you enjoyed it.
